Hi! I’m **Vahid Jebraeeli**, a final-year Ph.D. researcher in Electrical & Computer Engineering at **North Carolina State University** (minor in Mathematics), advised by **Prof. Hamid Krim** in the VISSTAL Lab. I build scalable, **data-efficient generative and vision systems**, translating new theory into performant models and practical tools. My work spans transformer dynamics, controllable autoencoders, diffusion, and dataset synthesis/condensation for low-data regimes.&#x20;
