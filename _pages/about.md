In an era of exponentially growing AI, my work asks a critical question: **How do we achieve intelligent scale sustainably?**

I am a machine learning researcher and a final-year Ph.D. candidate at North Carolina State University, where I architect the next generation of generative models and vision systems. My focus is on building AI that is not only powerful but also profoundly efficient, moving beyond brute-force computation to create systems with elegance and precision.

## My Research: Data Synthesis and Model Dynamics

Today's AI demands immense datasets and computational power. My research confronts this challenge head-on by reimagining how machines learn and generate information.

* **Architecting Novel Data Frameworks**: I build systems that master the data itself. My **"Koopcon"** model, published in ICIP 2024, uses Koopman Operator Theory to distill massive datasets into compact, potent essences—proving that smaller can be smarter. Conversely, my **"Expansive Synthesis"** framework (ICASSP 2025) can grow a rich, large-scale dataset from just a few samples, enabling powerful learning even when data is scarce.

* **Innovating Core AI Architectures**: I don't just use existing models; I redesign them from the ground up. I am currently developing **ViTCAE**, a new class of Vision Transformer for more controllable and efficient image synthesis. My work also explores the fusion of classical Volterra Filters with modern attention mechanisms, creating models with a far richer understanding of both local detail and global context.

## My Journey

My path has been one of consistent academic excellence, from ranking in the top 0.3% in Iran's national university entrance exam to earning my M.Sc. with distinction from the prestigious Sharif University of Technology. This rigorous theoretical grounding is balanced by hands-on industry experience, where I’ve developed generative AI solutions in Germany and deployed deep learning models for the USDA.

I believe the future of AI lies not in its size, but in its intelligence. If you share this vision, I'd love to connect.
