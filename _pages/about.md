Hello! [cite_start]I'm Vahid Jebraeeli, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at **North Carolina State University**, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Hamid Krim[cite: 1].

My research is driven by a central question: How can we build AI systems that are not only powerful but also efficient, scalable, and sustainable? [cite_start]I specialize in machine learning and deep learning, with a deep focus on large-scale generative models and foundational vision systems[cite: 1]. [cite_start]My work spans the full research lifecycle—from exploring novel theories and mathematical foundations to implementing and optimizing state-of-the-art models[cite: 1]. [cite_start]With over eight years of experience, I am passionate about tackling complex challenges in multimodal content generation and efficient learning[cite: 1].

## My Research Focus

[cite_start]My doctoral thesis, **“Balanced Scalability for Sustainable ML: Novel Data Synthesis and Transformer Dynamics for Efficient AI Systems”**[cite: 1], encapsulates my core research interests. I am dedicated to pioneering methods that enhance AI capabilities while minimizing computational and data-related costs.

My key research pillars include:

* **Pioneering Data-Efficient Learning**: I design frameworks that address the "small data" problem. [cite_start]My work on **"Expansive Synthesis"** creates vast, high-fidelity datasets from minimal samples using expander graph mappings, a project published at ICASSP 2025[cite: 1]. [cite_start]On the other end of the spectrum, my **"Koopcon"** model, which leverages Koopman Operator Theory and Optimal Transport, condenses massive datasets into compact, information-rich representations without sacrificing performance, as published in ICIP 2024[cite: 1].

* **Innovating Generative Architectures**: I am deeply involved in redesigning the building blocks of generative AI. [cite_start]My recent projects include **ViTCAE**, a novel Vision Transformer-based autoencoder that enhances controllable image synthesis, and a unique architecture that synergizes **Volterra Filters and Vision Transformers** to capture both non-linear local features and global context[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]**Optimizing Transformer Dynamics**: I investigate the fundamental mechanics of Vision Transformers (ViTs)[cite: 1]. [cite_start]By analyzing the evolution of attention mechanisms using tools like the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), I develop novel optimization strategies to guide ViTs toward more efficient and stable convergence[cite: 1].

## My Journey

My passion for electrical engineering and artificial intelligence began long before my Ph.D. [cite_start]I was honored to rank in the top 0.3% of over 223,000 participants in the national university entrance exam, which led me to my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at **Amirkabir University of Technology**[cite: 1]. [cite_start]I continued my academic pursuit at the prestigious **Sharif University of Technology**, where I earned my M.Sc. with distinction and ranked 3rd in my cohort[cite: 1]. These formative experiences in Iran provided me with a rigorous foundation in signal processing, mathematics, and machine learning.

Beyond academia, I have translated my research into tangible solutions in various industry roles. [cite_start]As a Senior ML Engineer in Germany, I developed generative models for style transfer and high-resolution media generation[cite: 1]. [cite_start]More recently, during an internship with the **USDA**, I designed and deployed a YOLOv8-based deep learning model for agricultural applications, including blueberry detection, segmentation, and maturity analysis[cite: 1].

I am always eager to connect with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and anyone passionate about the future of AI. Please feel free to reach out!
