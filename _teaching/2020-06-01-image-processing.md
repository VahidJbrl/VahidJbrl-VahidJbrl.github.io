Served as a Teaching Assistant for the Image Processing course, a graduate-level class taught by Dr. Shahrokh Ghaemmaghami. My role involved supporting students in understanding both the theoretical and practical aspects of digital image analysis.

Course Content Overview
======
The course provided a comprehensive introduction to digital image processing techniques. Key areas included image representation, enhancement in spatial and frequency domains, image restoration, color image processing, and image segmentation. The practical component heavily relied on implementing these algorithms in MATLAB and Python.

My Responsibilities
======
* Conducted weekly recitation sessions to review lecture materials and solve complex problems.
* Designed and graded homework assignments and programming labs that reinforced concepts like filtering, Fourier transforms, and morphological operations.
* Held regular office hours to provide one-on-one assistance to students, helping them debug code and clarify theoretical concepts.
* Assisted the professor in preparing course materials and exam questions.

Key Topics Covered
======
* **Image Enhancement:** Techniques such as histogram equalization, contrast stretching, and spatial filtering (e.g., smoothing and sharpening filters).
* **Frequency Domain Processing:** The 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), filtering in the frequency domain (e.g., low-pass, high-pass), and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
* **Image Segmentation:** Thresholding, edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny operators), region-based segmentation, and an introduction to watershed segmentation.
* **Feature Extraction:** Introduction to keypoint detectors and descriptors like SIFT and SURF, which are foundational for many computer vision tasks.
