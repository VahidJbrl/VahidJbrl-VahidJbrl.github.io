I acted as the Head Teaching Assistant for the Digital Communication Systems course, instructed by Dr. Hamidreza Amindavar. This course focused on the principles and techniques used in modern digital communication networks.

Course Syllabus Overview
======
The curriculum covered the end-to-end process of digital communication, from analog-to-digital conversion to transmission over a noisy channel. Major topics included the sampling theorem, quantization, pulse code modulation (PCM), baseband and passband digital transmission, and performance analysis in the presence of noise.

Responsibilities and Contributions
======
* Organized and led lab sessions where students implemented digital modulation schemes (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, FSK) using MATLAB/Simulink.
* Developed supplementary course materials, including tutorials on probability theory for communication and guides for simulation projects.
* Managed the team of teaching assistants, delegated grading responsibilities, and maintained the official course gradebook.
* Provided extensive support during office hours on complex topics such as matched filtering and intersymbol interference (ISI).

Technical Topics Explained
======
* **Baseband Signaling:** Formats like Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ), Manchester coding, and techniques to mitigate Intersymbol Interference (ISI), such as pulse shaping with Nyquist filters.
* **Passband Digital Modulation:** Coherent and non-coherent detection of digital modulation schemes, including Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK), Phase-Shift Keying (PSK), and Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK).
* **Performance Analysis:** Calculation of Bit Error Rate (BER) for various modulation schemes in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, and understanding the trade-offs between power and bandwidth.
