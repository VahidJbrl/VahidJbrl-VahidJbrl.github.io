As the Head Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate Communication Systems course, I led the TA team and facilitated the learning process for a large class of students. The course covered the fundamental principles of analog and digital communication.

Course Description
======
This foundational course explored the theory and application of communication systems. Topics included the analysis of signals and systems, various analog modulation techniques (AM, FM), the effects of noise in communication channels, and an introduction to digital modulation and information theory.

Role as Head TA
======
* Coordinated the duties of the teaching assistant team, including standardizing grading rubrics and managing assignment schedules.
* Led comprehensive review sessions for midterm and final exams, summarizing key concepts and working through example problems.
* Served as the primary liaison between the students and the professor, communicating feedback and addressing students' concerns.
* Managed the grading process for all homework and exams, ensuring fairness and consistency.

Core Topics Assisted
======
* **Analog Modulation:** In-depth analysis of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM), including modulation/demodulation circuits, bandwidth requirements, and performance in noise.
* **Random Processes & Noise:** Introduction to stochastic processes, power spectral density, and modeling the effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) on system performance.
* **Signal Analysis:** Application of Fourier series and Fourier transforms for representing and analyzing signals in communication systems.
