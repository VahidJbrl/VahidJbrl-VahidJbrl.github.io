In this role as Head Teaching Assistant for Digital Communication Systems course, I was responsible for guiding students through the core concepts of digital signal transmission and reception.

Course Summary
======
This course provided a rigorous foundation in digital communications. It began with source digitization and moved through baseband and passband signaling techniques, channel modeling, and performance evaluation based on probability of error. It laid the groundwork for advanced topics like information theory and error-control coding.

My Contributions as Head TA
======
* Created and graded weekly homework assignments that challenged students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.
* Proctored and graded midterm and final examinations.
* Held weekly office hours to assist students with homework and deepen their understanding of lecture topics.
* Helped students debug their code for simulation labs focused on modeling communication links and calculating bit error rates.

Key Learning Objectives Supported
======
* **Source Coding and Digitization:** Understanding the Sampling Theorem, quantization (uniform and non-uniform), and Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).
* **Optimal Receiver Design:** The principles of matched filtering for maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of AWGN.
* **Information Theory Introduction:** Basic concepts such as channel capacity, as defined by the Shannon-Hartley theorem, to understand the theoretical limits of communication.
